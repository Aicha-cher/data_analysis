Notebooks for data analysis 


1) Feature Engineering --> Tweet Analysis
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (Geo Pandas) and Data Visualization --> Sales Data Analysis
3) End to End ML Case Study (involves data cleaning, data wrangling, data visualization, feature engineering, model selection and hyper parameter tuning, results and insights) --> Heart Disease Prediction
4) ML Case Study using unsupervised learning as well to extract features, using models like GLRM, Boosting algorithms to predict--> Auto Insurance Claim Prediction


- For Exploratory Data Analysis tutorial check out the Jupyter Notebooks: 1) Energy Star Prediction inspired by Will Koehrsen; 2) Titanic inspired by jkarakas
